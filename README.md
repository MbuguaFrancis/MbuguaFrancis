- 👋 Hi, I’m @MbuguaFrancis
- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud computing and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and have been for a while so by December 2021, I should be able to deploy a project making use of siamese networks to detect images on top of the normal CNN.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that lies within the cloud computing domain. 
- 📫 How to reach me email: kamaafranc@gmail.com
